Here are clear, exam-style notes listing only what is NOT done or NOT done correctly, written so you can copy them directly into your checklist or planning document.

❌ Not Done / Not Done Correctly (Important Notes)
1. Flask Backend (Python) — Not Done

The project brief requires a Flask backend written in Python.

The submitted app uses Node.js / Express with TypeScript, which does not meet the specified requirement.

This is a major compliance issue and risks significant mark loss.

2. Persistent JSON File Storage — Not Done

Reflections and projects are stored in memory only.

Data is lost when the server restarts.

The brief and labs expect persistent storage using JSON files (especially in Lab 5–7).

Current implementation does not satisfy data persistence requirements.

3. Third-Party API Integration — Not Evident

No clear use of an external / third-party API (e.g. weather, news, quotes).

Internal API endpoints alone do not count as third-party API usage.

This requirement must be visible in the app and explained in the portfolio.

4. Deployment to Required Platform — Not Done

The assessment brief specifies deployment (e.g. PythonAnywhere).

The app is not deployed on a required hosting platform.

No live URL is available to include in the portfolio.

5. Portfolio Lab Reflections (Labs 1–7) — Not Done

The portfolio template requires written reflections for each lab.

These reflections are mandatory assessment evidence.

Currently missing or not evidenced.

6. Mini Project Reflection (Sections 9.1–9.4) — Not Done

The mini project exists (Game page), but:

No written reflection answering 9.1–9.4 in the portfolio.

No explanation of design choices, challenges, or learning outcomes.

7. Browser API Usage — Not Clearly Demonstrated

The brief requires use of at least one browser API.

Usage (e.g. LocalStorage, Notifications, etc.) is not clearly identifiable or explained.

Must be explicitly shown and justified in the portfolio.

8. Accessibility Evidence — Not Evidenced

No clear documentation of:

Semantic HTML

ARIA attributes

Colour contrast or keyboard navigation

Accessibility must be explained and justified, not just assumed.

9. GitHub Repository Evidence — Unclear

A GitHub repository link is required in the portfolio.

Version control usage is not currently evidenced.

⚠️ Summary (Marker Perspective)

Your frontend + PWA are solid.

Your backend and assessment compliance are the main problems.

Without fixing Flask + JSON storage + portfolio evidence, the project may be judged as technically good but non-compliant.
